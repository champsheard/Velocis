# Project Velocis

**Author: Euwain Sheard**

**Description Ultra Fast CoreXY auto ejecting 3d Printer**

**Total time spent: *3.5h***

## May 24 (Day 1): Started CADing and Part Sourcing

I started by looking at various parts and how they would fit into my project. This is what I decided on so far

| Part    | Price |
| -------- | ------- |
| Phaetus RAPIDO HOTEND  | $80    |
| Octopus Pro | $70    |
| Orbiter v2.5 | $50 |

I might change this later, but I like these parts

Now to Cad! I have taken inspiration from the [Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident) for the design of the frame and triple lead screw z axis

I am, however, having trouble with the extrusion files I found...

**Time spent: 2h**

## Day 1 Part 2

I worked on the Cad some more. I fixed the extrusion problems by uses [these](https://www.printables.com/model/312162-2020-2040-3030-3060-aluminum-extrusions/files) files instead. However this meant that I had to redesign the frame. When I redesigned the frame I decided to change some of the extrusion lengths. Now instead of 370, and 500, I shortened the extrusions to 350 and 450. I also modeled some of the x, and z gantry. I also organized some of the components, mainly the extrusions, into folders. I am going to use a mixture of Fusion 360's internal and external component options.
