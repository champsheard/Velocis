# May 24: Started CADing and Part Sourcing

I started by looking at various parts and how they would fit into my project. This is what I decided on so far

| Part    | Price |
| -------- | ------- |
| Phaetus RAPIDO HOTEND  | $80    |
| Octopus Pro | $70    |
| Orbiter v2.5 | $50 |

I might change this later, but I like these parts

Now to Cad! I have taken inspiration from the [Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident) for the design of the frame and triple lead screw z axis
