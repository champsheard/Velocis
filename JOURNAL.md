# Project Velocis

**Author: Euwain Sheard**

**Description Ultra Fast CoreXY auto ejecting 3d Printer**

**Total time spent: *6.5h***

## May 24 (Day 1): Started CADing and Part Sourcing

I started by looking at various parts and how they would fit into my project. This is what I decided on so far

| Part    | Price |
| -------- | ------- |
| Phaetus RAPIDO HOTEND  | $80    |
| Octopus Pro | $70    |
| Orbiter v2.5 | $50 |

I might change this later, but I like these parts

Now to Cad! I have taken inspiration from the [Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident) for the design of the frame and triple lead screw z axis

I am, however, having trouble with the extrusion files I found...

**Time spent: 2h**

## Day 1 Part 2

I worked on the Cad some more. I fixed the extrusion problems by uses [these](https://www.printables.com/model/312162-2020-2040-3030-3060-aluminum-extrusions/files) files instead. However this meant that I had to redesign the frame. When I redesigned the frame I decided to change some of the extrusion lengths. Now instead of 370, and 500, I shortened the extrusions to 350 and 450. I also modeled some of the x, and z gantry. I also organized some of the components, mainly the extrusions, into folders. I am going to use a mixture of Fusion 360's internal and external component options.

## May 25 (Day 2): Cad

I started today by finishing CADing the basic frame, and looking at various linear rails. I found [these](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832586981749.html?spm=2114.12010612.8148356.4.46a27cbep2UDWu&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt) on the Voron sourcing guide for my y axis, but I am going to shop around for better prices. I am going to attach the Linear rails on the bottom of the aluminum extrusions, so I can install a cable chain later. 

I haven't CADed the linear rails yet, maybe I'll do that later today.

## Day 2 Part 2: Cad

I started by finding models of the linear rails I am going to use. I am going with **MGN9H** for the y axis, which is what I am designing. I have no idea how this is all going to fit into the budget. 

Then I started to CAD. I first modified the length of the files I found from 390 mm to 300 to use them in my design. Then I imported them and attached them to my frame with joints. Then I imported the carriages into the design and used a sliding joint to attach them to the rail. It took me a little time to figure out, but in the end I got it. I then imported another aluminum extrusion to work as my x axis.
